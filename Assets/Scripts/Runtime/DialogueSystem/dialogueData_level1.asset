        what kind of environment it lived in, like if it was a shallow or deep ocean.
        And guess what? Geologists can also use ammonite fossils to figure out how
        old rocks are!

        concept tells us that younger rock layers are found on top of older ones.
        Just like when you build a tower of blocks, the newer blocks are placed above
        the older ones. Geologists use superposition to decipher the order of rock
        layers and understand the relative ages of fossils. As you explore further,
        remember that the principle of superposition is your guide to unraveling
        Earth's timeline!
